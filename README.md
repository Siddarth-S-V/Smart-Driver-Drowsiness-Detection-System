# Smart-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Developed a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Raspberry Pi 4 and YOLO-based image processing to monitor eye state in real time. The system detects drowsiness by analyzing prolonged eye closure and triggers alerts to improve driver safety. Combined computer vision, deep learning, and embedded hardware into a cost-effective solution.
